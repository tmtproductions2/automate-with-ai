        <h1>AI Marketing Toolkit for Solopreneurs</h1>
        <p>Automate your growth in 2025 with curated prompts, workflow templates and actionable guidance.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how solo entrepreneurs run their businesses. According to Shopify’s 2025 guides, digital products like templates and AI‑enhanced tools are among the most profitable items you can create and sell online【151020984857469†L246-L259】. Affiliate marketing has also exploded into a multibillion‑dollar industry, letting creators earn commissions by promoting software and services【639345320113438†L150-L159】. This toolkit combines both trends: it gives you ready‑to‑use AI prompts and automation workflows that you can use yourself or package as digital products to sell or offer as a lead magnet.</p>
